## DataSF Dataset
#### This dataset is collection of government, infastructure, and cultural information from the City and County of San Francisco. 

The data includes community resources like Public Parks and Cultural Districts. These can provide value through mapping park locations for commmunity accessibity, and adding dimensionality by showing the most convenient public transit routes to arrive. This community-focused map can also include public art accessible to the all along the way. Other facilites like public restrooms, public gardens, sports areas, and playgrounds also enrich a visitor's experience in the San Francisco. I see this data source being very useful to both tourists wanting an inexpensive cultural tour of the city, as well as locals looking to find something new. 

The data also shows specific city assets like public trash cans. San Francisco is often notorious for having messy streets littered with trash. Data on trash can locations can be overlayed with heavily populated walking areas, public transit stops, and community spaces where more debris is likely to collect. Data can also be brought in about the public's opinion on specific neighborhood's messsiness and trash levels. Analysts can determine which streets need more trash cans from this data, and track their progress through updated survey results.

## The Data Journalism Handbook 1
#### by Liliana Bounegru, Lucy Chambers, and Johnathan Gray, produced by the European Journalism Centre
This book promises to be a journalist's guide to collecting, understanding, and transforming data into a compelling story. This book is interesting because it is data literacy focused on non-engineers, which is extremely valuable. Journalists shape our constant media consumption, and ensuring they are successfully interpreting their data is invaluable to our society. As our world collects more and more information, data literacy books focused on non-technical careers will increase. Books like these are important when most data is unfiltered, biased, and often incomplete. More people can now weild the power of data, and we must make sure they use it responsibily.
